## Overview

My 6th challenge on the frontend mentor website.

Pretty standard stuff, but it marks the first time I do a mobile first development for a frontend mentor challenge.
I employed what I have learnt from the last project especially regarding responsiveness so it made the challenge a breeze and I felt the progress.

- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Read more on the img's srcset attribute - completely forgot about this one -, also read more and practice the picture element and other responsive design techniques and properties especially for images, i.e: things like object-fit and the like.
